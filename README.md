# Hey there! 👋

I'm Maliha, a web development learner from India.

I enjoy creating clean and simple experiences across different types of projects. I work with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, and I’ve built PWA apps, web apps, mobile-friendly apps, multi-page websites, gaming websites, and various clone projects using modern and emerging tools.

Right now, I’m focusing on improving my JavaScript skills, making responsive layouts, and learning React.

In my pinned repos, you’ll find a mix of apps, website clones, experiments, and projects I built while learning. More will be added as I continue exploring and improving every day.
